This chapter walks users through experiment configuration options for various severe weather events. It assumes that users have already :ref:`built the SRW App <BuildSRW>` successfully. 

Users can run through the entire set of tutorials or jump to the one that interests them most. The first tutorial is recommended for users who have never run the SRW App before. The five tutorials address different skills:

   #. :ref:`Severe Weather Over Indianapolis <fcst1>`: Change physics suites and compare graphics plots. 
   #. :ref:`Cold Air Damming <fcst2>`: Coming soon!
   #. :ref:`Southern Plains Winter Weather Event <fcst3>`: Coming soon!
   #. :ref:`Halloween Storm <fcst4>`: Change :term:`IC/LBC <ics/lbcs>` sources and compare results. 
   #. :ref:`Hurricane Barry <fcst5>`: Coming soon!
   #. :ref:`Choose your own adventure! <fcst6>`: Create a forecast of your choice on a custom grid using publicly available data. 

Each section provides a summary of the weather event and instructions for configuring an experiment.
